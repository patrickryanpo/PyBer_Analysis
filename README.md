Urban cities have presented as the type of cities with the most rides and drivers, which has resulted as the highest fare amount amongst the three ciry types. When looking at the average fare per ride, it can be concluded that as the number of rides increase, the average fare per ride decreases. 

One notable finding that can be seen in this data summary is that the number of total drivers exceed the total number of rides for urban cities. It may be a strong indication on why the average fare per driver of suburban cities is 138% higher than that of urban cities.

As illustrated by the line chart above, it is evident that urban cities charge the highest fares, followed by suburban cities, and then rural cities.
