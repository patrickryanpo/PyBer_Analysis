# Overview of the analysis: 

## Purpose of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Included in this analysis is a multiple-line graph that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type. 

### Tools Used: JupyterNotebook, Python 3.7.9, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Data Summary 

![Pyber Summary DF](https://github.com/patrickryanpo/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/pyber_summary_df.png)

Urban cities have presented as the type of cities with the most rides and drivers, which has resulted as the highest fare amount amongst the three ciry types. When looking at the average fare per ride, it can be concluded that as the number of rides increase, the average fare per ride decreases. 

One notable finding that can be seen in this data summary is that the number of total drivers exceed the total number of rides for urban cities. It may be a strong indication on why the average fare per driver of suburban cities is 138% higher than that of urban cities. 

## Weekly Fares by City Type

As illustrated by the line chart above, it is evident that urban cities charge the highest fares, followed by suburban cities, and then rural cities. 


# Summary
The data shows that there are notable disparities when it comes to the number of rides, drivers, and average fares across all three city types. These disparities cause a big gap when it comes to fare prices. 

With this, I present the following recommendations:

- Increase marketing spend for rural cities to encourage more riders to use the service 
- Incentivize urban drivers to serve suburban or rural areas to balance the supply and demand in across three city types
- Strategize for customer acquisition that would result to an increase in total fare
